This is my father's photographer's website made with Gatsby.

The website was created using the Gatsby Default Starter (https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) and then customized.

The website displays many photos organized in different categories. The photos themselves are posted via GraphQL queries.

It has been deployed and it is available live at this link: https://vincenzo-raimondi.netlify.app/
